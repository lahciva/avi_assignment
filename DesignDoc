HelloWeb:

Design Approach:
1- Implemented MVC structure as I've experience of such framework. Could have used other frameworks, but due to time issues, chose the fastest option.
2- Designed Hello World program first, to make the basics working.
3- Modified this program to navigate from home page to solution page or exception page.
4- To parse mathematical expression, used Nashorn JavaScript in Java i.e. scripting.
5- Added logs for better understanding of flow.

Improvement Scope:
1- Add more complex mathematical operations
2- Improve front end
